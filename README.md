# A selection of Window Maker Themes

Here are some themes for Window Maker. They're actually my favourites,
and are shipped as the TRIBwmaker-themes package in Tribblix.

## OpenSolaris

This is a theme I wrote myself, taking one of the OpenSolaris desktop
backgrounds and playing with the menu colours.

## Raystone

This is nostalgia, it was the theme I used most of the time.

## Niagara

Another of my favourites, reminding me of when I went to visit.
